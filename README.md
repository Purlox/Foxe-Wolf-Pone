Foxe Wolf Pone (Tic Tac Toe)
============================

Tic Tac Toe made in Haskell, with the option to render it with animal characters from Unicode.


Use command arguments to tell the executable if to use animal or standard (Tic Tac Toe) rendering. You can also use "help" as a command argument in case you aren't sure what the arguments are exactly.
